# Tripleten test of Diego Richalski dos Santos

'''sh
To complete exercise 1: Task 1. Working with data, it took me 6 hours

For the completion of exercise 2: Task 2. Problem-solving, it took me 8 hours. To be honest, I didn't know a way to work with a cohort. Soon I went to learn a little more about it.

To complete exercise 3: Task 3. Answering student questions, it took me 15 minutes. I did it on google doc, follow the link:

For exercise 4. Frankly, I don't know how to do it. But studying a little I managed to come up with an answer. Yes, this answer was given by an artificial intelligence.

To find the variance of the random variable Z = 2X - 3Y, we can use the properties of variance and covariance.
First, let’s calculate the mean of Z: E(Z) = E(2X - 3Y) = 2E(X) - 3E(Y) = 2 * 0.5 - 3 * 7 = -18.5
Next, let’s calculate the covariance of Z with itself: cov(Z, Z) = cov(2X - 3Y, 2X - 3Y) = cov(2X, 2X) + cov(2X, -3Y) + cov(-3Y, 2X) + cov(-3Y, -3Y) = 4 * cov(X, X) - 6 * cov(X, Y) - 6 * cov(Y, X) + 9 * cov(Y, Y) = 4 * Var(X) - 6 * cov(X, Y) - 6 * cov(X, Y) + 9 * Var(Y) = 4 * 2 - 6 * (-0.8) - 6 * (-0.8) + 9 * 3.5 = 8 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 31.5 = 49.1
Finally, the variance of Z can be calculated as the covariance of Z with itself: Var(Z) = cov(Z, Z) = 49.1
Therefore, the variance of the random variable Z = 2X - 3Y is 49.1.
